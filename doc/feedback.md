Below is some feedback and considerations regarding whether this code is “production ready” and “safe.” Overall, it’s a decent foundation—there are good security measures such as Helmet for headers, bcrypt-hashed passwords, limited request rates, JWT authentication, etc. But there are several things you’ll want to verify, adjust, or add to ensure better production-readiness and security.
High-Level Observations

    Environment Variables
        You’re relying on environment variables like JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, and SODIUM_KEY. Make sure these are properly set in your production environment and never checked in to version control.
        You may want to verify that your environment variables are present on startup. For example, if JWT_SECRET is undefined, your JWT handling is unsafe.

    TLS/HTTPS Enforcement
        In production, you do enforce HTTPS (via the app.use(...) redirect and using https.createServer). That’s good. Just be sure your SSL certificates (process.env.SSL_KEY_PATH, etc.) are correct, rotated regularly, and that you handle certificate errors carefully.

    CORS
        In the Socket.IO configuration, you have cors: { origin: false }. Typically, that means “do not allow cross-origin requests” at all. That might be correct for your scenario. If you actually need cross-origin WebSocket connections, you should configure it properly (e.g., origin: ["https://myproductiondomain.com"]).
        For the Express endpoints, you haven’t shown a cors() middleware. If you do need cross-origin access, you must explicitly enable and configure cors as well. If you don’t need cross-origin access, that’s fine. Just confirm that’s the intended behavior.

    Helmet Config
        You are already using Helmet with HSTS, frameguard, noSniff, and script-src. That’s good. Double-check you’re okay with the default CSP settings and confirm you’re not inadvertently breaking any third-party scripts you might rely on.
        If you serve static assets or use inline scripts, you may need to refine your CSP directives further.

    Rate-Limiting & Slow Down
        You apply rateLimit globally and also more aggressively on the login route, which is a solid anti-bruteforce measure.
        Make sure your rate-limit values (max=50, max=5, etc.) are suitable for production—they might be too strict (impacting real users) or not strict enough. Tweak them based on your load expectations.
        Also confirm whether you need a more robust system like Redis-based rate-limiting if you plan to run multiple server instances behind a load balancer.

    Sequelize Sync in Production
        You are doing await sequelize.sync({ alter: true }). In production, typically you do not want to do sync({ alter: true }) (nor force: true) automatically. Instead, you’d manage schema changes via migrations so you can control each DB upgrade/downgrade step.
        sync({ alter: true }) tries to automatically alter tables, which can be dangerous or slow in production. If the database is large or your schema changes are big, it might block.
        A better approach is to remove sync() from production and run migrations in a separate step.

Security & Validation Considerations

    Input Validation
        You have some regex checks for emails, passwords, player names, etc. That’s good.
        However, watch out for places you allow user input but only lightly validate (e.g., some routes check if (!validateIpOrLocalhost(ip)) ... but do you also want to limit string length or ensure no weird unicode?).
        For anything that eventually gets stored or used in queries, it’s a good practice to have stricter length and character-set checks, or to sanitize further.

    JSON Responses
        Your jsonRes helper is returning JSON in the format { message, error, data }. That’s usually fine. Just ensure your front-end always checks error before trusting data.
        Some folks prefer HTTP status codes (4xx/5xx) + error responses. Right now, everything returns a 200 OK with a JSON body, even on errors. You may want to standardize that approach or switch to proper HTTP status codes.

    JWT
        You’re using short-lived access tokens (15m) and rotating refresh tokens (7d) that are hashed in the DB. That is a solid pattern.
        Be sure that your JWT_SECRET is cryptographically secure (like a 32+ character random string) in production.
        You might also want to handle token revocation. Currently, you do “rolling refresh” by storing a new hashed refresh token each time. This is good, but if a user logs out on device A, they remain authenticated on device B. Decide on your requirements for multi-device.
        If an attacker ever steals a valid JWT, the only recourse is to wait for it to expire or rotate secrets.

    Encryption with libsodium
        You’re using crypto_secretbox with a SODIUM_KEY. That’s fine for the ID encryption. Just be sure that this key is 32 bytes and not reused for other cryptographic tasks.
        Confirm that the environment variable SODIUM_KEY is actually set to a 32-byte base64-encoded value. If it’s the wrong length or empty, your code will throw an error.

    CSRF Protection
        If your routes are strictly consumed by single-page apps or external clients that store tokens in memory, you might not need CSRF tokens. Typically, CSRF is a concern if you set cookies with HttpOnly + SameSite=None.
        Right now, you appear to use tokens in an Authorization header, so that’s not typically subject to CSRF. Confirm your threat model.
        If your front-end uses cookies for the JWT or refresh tokens, you’ll likely need a standard CSRF or double-submit cookie pattern.

    Logging
        You use winston with DailyRotateFile, which is good. Double-check you’re not logging any sensitive info (e.g., do not log raw passwords, tokens, or PII).
        The code does logger.error(e) in catch blocks—be mindful of whether exceptions might contain user data or secrets. Possibly sanitize them before writing to logs.

Operational / Deployment Tips

    Process Management
        In production, you usually run Node apps with something like pm2, forever, or Docker containers orchestrated by Docker Compose / Kubernetes. Make sure you have an automated restart policy if the server crashes.

    Database
        You’re using Postgres with Sequelize. Production deployments often require connection pools, cluster configurations, or at least a plan for backups and failovers. Check your pool config in Sequelize if you expect high concurrency.
        Periodically vacuum / analyze your DB if needed, and ensure your Games, Users, etc. tables have proper indexes for queries.

    Mail or Email Verification
        You have an Activation table with a token, but I don’t see you sending an actual email to the user. Possibly you’re doing that in some code not shown here. Make sure you actually send the activation link to the user’s email so they can confirm their account. Also, ensure the link includes the correct domain, e.g. https://yourdomain.com/api_v1/confirm/${token}.

    Production Build
        Make sure you’re building your app with the appropriate Node version, and that you handle logs + error reporting properly. Possibly incorporate something like Sentry.io or other monitoring.
        If your load grows, keep an eye on CPU usage for encryption (bcrypt hashing, libsodium, JWT signing, etc.) and consider ways to scale horizontally.

Summary

Pros:

    You’ve employed many best practices: helmet, bcrypt hashing, JWT short-lived tokens with refresh tokens, logging with rotation, rate-limiting, slow-down for logins, etc.
    The structure is relatively clear, and you’ve separated concerns decently (routes, SSE, user logic, etc.).

Areas to Improve:

    Make sure environment variables are correct and validated (especially secrets).
    Avoid sequelize.sync({ alter: true }) in production—use migrations.
    Add stronger input validation for all user-facing data.
    Return appropriate HTTP status codes (4xx/5xx) instead of always 200 OK with an error in JSON.
    Add CSRF protection if you end up storing tokens in cookies.
    Carefully handle logging so no sensitive info is leaked.
    Check CORS config carefully for WebSocket usage in production.

In short, the code has a good baseline of security features, but you still need to verify environment configurations and address a few typical production pitfalls (DB migrations, logging, secrets management, etc.). Once those are handled, you’ll be well on your way to a more production-ready system.
