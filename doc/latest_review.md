Below is a blunt, high-level review of what looks good, and what’s potentially risky or incomplete for a real-world production server:

The Good Stuff:

    Security Basics
        You’re hashing passwords with bcrypt.
        Refresh tokens get hashed too (nice move; many folks forget).
        Helmet is in use with CSP, HSTS, frameguard, and other standard protections.
        Rate limiting and slow-down for logins.
    Environment Validation
        Consistent checks on env vars (length, existence, etc.).
        Early crash if something is missing, which is good to avoid half-broken deployments.
    Logging Practices
        Winston + rotating files is nice.
        There’s a redaction filter for known sensitive keys.

Major Things to Watch Out For:

    Storing “Admin” Credentials in Plain Env Vars
        You rely on ADMIN_USER_NAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD for your admin user. If these leak (logs, build artifacts, etc.), or if .env files get committed somewhere, that’s a big hole. At minimum, clarify how you keep .env safe or move admin creation to a more robust provisioning mechanism.

    User Creation / Activation Flow
        You’re sending email-based confirmations. That’s good, but if you rely on real mail flows, your mailer config and environment secrets (SMTP user/password) must be stored with care.
        Make sure you handle bounce cases, or invalid email addresses. Right now, if nodemailer fails, it only logs an error.

    Logging of Potentially Sensitive Metadata
        Your Winston redaction is good, but any messages logged before your custom format stage (e.g. logger.warn('Invalid password format...')) may still contain details if you’re not careful. Usually it’s not critical, but keep an eye on placeholders that might reveal user inputs in logs.

    No CORS
        By design you said you’re not hooking up to browsers, so that’s fine if your real usage is truly non-browser clients only. Just be clear that if you ever pivot to a web-based client, you’ll need the usual CORS config.

    Validation Depth
        You have regex checks for usernames, game fields, etc. That’s good, but any user-supplied field can become a vector for injection or weird behavior if new fields appear later and skip validation. Just be aware that simple regex checks can miss certain edge cases.

    Game Lifecycle
        You’re storing active game data in activeGames in memory, and also in the DB. If you ever scale to multiple lobby servers, each instance will have its own activeGames. They won’t auto-sync. That’s not necessarily “insecure,” but can cause weird states for players in a multi-instance environment.

    Production SSL
        You handle HTTPS if USE_SSL is true, but rely on reading in the certificate from a file. Good for a single-box scenario. In real production, folks often terminate SSL at a load balancer / reverse proxy. If you do that, your code’s redirect from HTTP to HTTPS and trust proxy settings will need some double-checking.

Verdict

    Could it be published “as is”? For a private or small-scale real-world scenario, yes—it’s a decent baseline. You’ve got standard protections in place, and the code is fairly organized.
    Would I trust it for a big production launch? Not without hardening how secrets are stored/deployed, careful logging reviews, ensuring environment files aren’t leaked, and clarifying your multi-instance story (if you ever scale horizontally).

Overall, it’s not flagrantly insecure, but you must remain cautious about secret management, logs, and future changes. If this is your starting point, just keep an eye on the points above before you push it into a wide-scale production environment.
